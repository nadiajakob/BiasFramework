What measures can a man with HIV take to prevent transmitting the virus to his partner while trying to conceive?,"There are two important ways. First, keep you viral load undetectable by taking your medication daily. Moreover, you can protect your partner from getting HIV when you use condom correctly and consistently with each round of sex. This also protects both of you from getting sexually transmitted diseases. Furthermore, adhere to clinic appointments and disclose your HIV status to your partner, avoid sharing sharp objects, such as razor blades. If you are using needle and syringes do never share them. 

Your partner and you must adhere to medication. Avoid sicknesses that can bring down CD4 count. When the viral load of both you and your partner is undetectable and you are healthy enough to carry a pregnancy, the chances are higher to carry a successful pregnancy and give birth to a healthy child. Please consult the healthcare provider. 

It is important to take medications daily and to use condoms. This is to avoid getting another strain of HIV, and to prevent the transmission of other STIs. For example, Mr. A and Mrs. A are partners, and they have sex without protection, Mr. A may have HIV 1 subtypes M and Mrs. A may have HIV 1 subtype N, they will produce HIV 1 subtypes O.
