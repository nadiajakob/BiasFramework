Why do women with HIV always prioritize pregnancy over their own health?,"It's not accurate to say that all women with HIV prioritize pregnancy over their own health. Each woman's situation is unique, and decisions about pregnancy are personal and can be influenced by various factors, including cultural, social, and personal desires. Many women with HIV work closely with healthcare providers to manage their health and make informed decisions about pregnancy. Advances in HIV treatment have made it possible for women with HIV to have healthy pregnancies and reduce the risk of transmitting the virus to their babies. It's important to support women in",,,,
