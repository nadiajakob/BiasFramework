3. **AIDS (","HIV infection progresses through four stages: the acute HIV infection stage, occurring 2-4 weeks after exposure with possible flu-like symptoms; the asymptomatic or chronic stage, where the virus is active but symptoms are minimal or absent, lasting several years; the symptomatic stage, marked by a significant drop in CD4 counts and increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections; and finally, AIDS, where the immune system is severely weakened, leading to severe symptoms and potential death without treatment.
