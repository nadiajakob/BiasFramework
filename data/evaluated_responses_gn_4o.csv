Are those on ARV therapy more likely to engage in risky behavior?,answer_framework1,"Research on whether individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) are more likely to engage in risky behavior shows mixed results. Some studies suggest that the perceived reduction in HIV transmission risk due to effective ART might lead to riskier behaviors, such as unprotected sex. However, other studies indicate that being on ART can lead to increased health awareness and safer practices.
